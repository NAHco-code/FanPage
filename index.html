    <h2>A Modern Mozart</h2>
    
    <h4>Biography</h4>

    <ul>
      <li>[Born and raised in north London with two younger sisters 
          primarily by his single mother, who is a violinist, composer, 
          and professor at the Royal Academy of Music's Junior Academy.</li>

      <li>A self-declared autodidact.</li>
      
      <li>In 2011, he began uploading homemade, multi-instrumental content
          to YouTube. Which, caught the attention of Quincy Jones, 
          who introduced him to Herbie Hancock at .</li></li>

      <li>Was approached by MIT to create and develop musical hardware 
          and software developing a multimedia live performance featuring 
          six simultaneous looping stations capapable of simultaneous playback, 
          backed by synced real-time 3D-captured video loops, projected onto 
          a screen behind the instruments, and a vocal "Harmonizer" instrument 
          he designed, which enabled him to perform multi-voice harmonies 
          in real time</li>

      <li>In late 2015, he debuted his first album <em>In My Room.</em> Which, he 
          recorded and produced the album himself, playing every instrument. He wrote 
          eight of the eleven tunes, and recorded + mixed the album over three months 
          in the music room of his family home.</li>

      <li>In December 2016, Collier collaborated with 150 students at MIT to produce 
          a live concert in Kresge Auditorium titled "Imagination Off the Charts", 
          playing alongside orchestral arrangements of his repertoire. This residency 
          was the subject of a documentary film, which won a regional Emmy in June 2018.</li>

      <li>To date, Collier has debuted: four albums; nine non-album singles; 
          four Grammy Awards - and is nominated for three Grammy Awards in 2021, 
          including Album of the Year for Djesse Vol. 3; and two Jazz FM Awards.]</li>
